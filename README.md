# Application_for_work_with_virtual_ports
Serial Communication Terminal & Signal Generator
C++ / Qt 5.15 (Qt Widgets, Qt Serial Port, Qt Charts)
Developed a desktop application in C++ using Qt that emulates and extends serial terminal functionality (similar to Termite). The application enables bidirectional serial communication and real-time signal generation with graphical visualization.
Key responsibilities and features:
-Implemented serial communication using Qt Serial Port
-Designed a custom text-based communication protocol (OUT=ID,s1,s2,...)
-Developed line-based message parsing with internal buffering
-Implemented asynchronous data handling using Qt’s signal-slot mechanism
-Created configurable signal generator (amplitude, frequency, DC offset, waveform type)
-Implemented real-time data plotting using Qt Charts
-Designed GUI programmatically using Qt Widgets
-Tested communication using virtual COM port bridging (HHD Virtual Serial Port Tools)
This project demonstrates understanding of:
-Serial communication principles
-Event-driven programming
-Data parsing and stream processing
-Real-time signal generation and sampling
-Desktop GUI application development in C++
